# Grading_Program
This project is a simple program that assigns a grade to students based on their scores. The program takes a dictionary of student names and scores as input, and returns a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades.

## Usage
To use the program, you need to provide a dictionary of student names and scores in the format:

```
student_scores = {
    "Student 1": Score,
    "Student 2": Score,
    ...
}
```

Run the program.
The program will create a new dictionary called "student_grades" with student names as keys and their corresponding grades as values.
If a score is less than 0 or greater than 100, it will print an error message.
The program will then print the "student_grades" dictionary.
The program will then assign a grade to each student based on their score, and print the final "student_grades" dictionary.

## Error Handling
The program includes error handling for scores that are outside the range of 0-100. If a score is less than 0 or greater than 100, the program will print an error message in red color indicating that the score is out of range.

## Requirements
Requires Python 3.x to run.
